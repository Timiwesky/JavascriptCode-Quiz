# JavascriptCode-Quiz

## Description

I created this project to create a timed coding quiz web application for testing JavaScript fundamentals. The application provides a clean and responsive UI, dynamically updating content using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It allows users to know their knowledge through multiple-choice questions and answers and records their scores.

## Instructions

Create a code quiz that contains the following requirements:

* A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.

* Questions contain buttons for each answer.

* When answer is clicked, the next question appears

* If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock

The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.

* When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score
